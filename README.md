# OneTaskFocus
OneTaskFocus is an application designed to help you stay focused on one task at a time and avoid switch-tasking. The app features a simple reminder system with a major task name, a deliverable which explains what is expected as the result, a list of subtasks necessary to reach the final result, and a treat after the task is finished.
